### How I Developed this Project

When I got started with Coder, I created a Template based on [sharkymark/coder-react](https://github.com/sharkymark/coder-react). This template had a Create React App basic project set up, so I decided to work from there. I developed this project completely in a Coder workspace and pushed the code out to Github from there.

### Things included

- Material UI components and theme
- CSS Variables and MUI support via experimental CssVarsProvider
- Figma variables and tokens
- Custom theming
- React Router
- Recreation of App Bar, Templates Table, and Workspaces
- Custom Hooks
- Dialog Box Wizard
- Transitions and Animation

### Things I didn't get to or would do

- Tests
- CI/CD Deployment
- Responsive design
- Accessibility
- Convert CRA to Vite
- Light mode
- Table row deselection in (wizard 'select template' step)
